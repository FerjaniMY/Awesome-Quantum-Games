# Awesome Quantum Games
This list is inspired by [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme), but not intended to be awesome, but trying to be as complete as possible. 

## What are quantum games?
The definition of quantum games for this list is rather broad. Any game that have major component of quantum mechanics is a quantum game.

To start with, I will slowly include the games mentioned in James Wootton's medium article: https://medium.com/@decodoku/the-history-of-games-for-quantum-computers-a1de98859b5a This article include only the games which can potentially be played on real quantum computers.

At the first version, I am going to add the games in choronological order.
