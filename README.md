# Awesome Quantum Games
This list is inspired by [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme), but not intended to be awesome, but trying to be as complete as possible. 

To start with, I will slowly include the games mentioned in James Wootton's medium article: https://medium.com/@decodoku/the-history-of-games-for-quantum-computers-a1de98859b5a
